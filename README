This is shift-cipher, a tool for encrypting and decrypting shift-ciphered
sentences. For more information run it with the "-h" parameter.

Every Linux distribution around should do the task.

7. Bugs and known issues
########################################################

 - no bugs so far ... found one?
    If you think you have found a bug or you want to contribute,
    drop me a line via mail. You could also send me a patch with
    git format-patch and send it to me.

8. License stuff
########################################################

Because I don't think that anyone wants to use this in a proprietary 
product I give erveyone the "do whatever you want" - license. As long as I don't 
say anything different you can do whatever you want. Just tell me if you do.
